This repository contains code used to find gut oncomicrobiome signatures (GOMS) in ICI responders and non-responders and across 8 different cancers profiled with [MetaPhlAn 4](https://github.com/biobakery/MetaPhlAn) shown in the NRCO review.

To run the analysis, clone the repository and change the working directory to the repository. 

Raw SGB-level relative abundances for the samples can be accessed in the phyloseq objects saved in the /data directory.
