This repository contains code used to find gut oncomicrobiome signatures (GOMS) in ICI responders and non-responders and across 8 different cancers profiled with MetaPhlAn 4 () shown in the NRCO review.

To run the analysis, clone the repository and change the working directory to the repository. 

Raw SGB-level relative abundances for the samples can be found in the /data directory.
